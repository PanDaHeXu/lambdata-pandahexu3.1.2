# dspt12 s1m4 project

## Tests, README, License

After stumbling through the previous modules,
I have made adjustments to my files (added classes, methods, etc.)
and am ready for full cycle critiques.

### Part 1 - Tests
The only test I could think of for my functions 
was testing length of list to be added to a dataframe,
since the number of list items and number of df observations
must be equal. I created the tests, along with accompanying pytest fixtures.

### Part 2 - README
I am creating this README to explain what I'm doing in this module project.
I still haven't connected all the dots on how I can utilize these helper functions.

### Part 3 - License
I plan to add the MIT license. Though I still have more to learn about licenses,
I'm pretty sure whatever company I work for will have a legal team that sets licensing policies.
